# Disney Grabber App

C# app that periodically checks Disney World for reservations for popular reservations. Uses Disney's restaurant API to grab restaurant information. JSON info is parsed into objects and filtered based on user preferences such as date and time of day.

Results are sent to the console with a direct link to the booking page for that reservation time slot of choice.

## Example usage

- Open modify-this-code.cs and modify the code.
- Go to https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/en_CA/dining/#/reservations-accepted/
- Find a restaurant that you would like to book and click on the restaurant.
- Work out when the restaurant has open hours and choose an hour that you would like to have booked.
